# BC-Final-Project
This everything you need to run my final Project yourself!

Step 1.
To be able to run this program the easiest IDE to download and use immeadiatley is blueJ. Heres the link to the blueJ dowload page. https://www.bluej.org/
From here select the proper platform (mac, pc, etc) and download the installer. Once the installer is finished downloading, click on it and a install wizard should show up. In the wizard it will take you through a couple steps and you should make sure to know where you are saving it on your computer (blueJ will let you select the dowload path). With blueJ installed, find the application in the directory you installed it and run the application. 

It will show a graphic of blueJ and kings college london upon running then show a blank project in the top left there will buttons for new class, an arrow and compile, but you will not be able to press them (perhaps). 

If you are using a mac next to the apple in the top left while you select the blueJ application, it will say blueJ and immeadiatley to the right of that it will say project

Step 2.
By hovering over project a drop down menue will display where one of the option is to make a new project. Do so and it will prompt you to choose a location for saving the project, I reccomend somewhere easy like your desktop.

After making the project you should new be able to navigate through finder to the project directory where among other things it will show a file called "package.bluej" if you see this file, you are in the project directory.

Step 3.
Once you have located your project directory, download the variety of png's in this repository and save them into the blueJ project directory.

After you have all the images, select one of the files in the repository which ends in .java
This is the code

 Step 4.
When you select a .java file there will be an option to view the "RAW" file, select this and the code will be displayed in a new page which only includes the code.

Once you are viewing the RAR, press Command A to highlight the entire program.
Once highlited, press command c to copy.

With the program coppied, go back to the blueJ application itself.
Currently you will have an empty project with a not epaper in the top left, but now you should be able to click on "new class"
When you click the button for a new class there will be a variety of options to select, but you need worry about none of it, use the default options.

All you need to do is enter the class name, which cna anything; you will be overwiting it in a moment anyway by coping over the code from the RAW file.

Once you made the class press the compile button.

Once you've compiled, open the code for the class by double clicking the rectangle which has the name of the clas or by right clicking and selecting open editor.

From here press command A again, then delete and press command V.
You should now have deleted what was there previously and copied over the program from this repository. 

Now the class name should be overwitten and you have sucsesfully copied over a program into the project. If there are issues click on the "compile" button in blueJ and or quit and re-open blueJ.

When you delete and paste in the editor it may lag a little but that is nothing to worry about.

Step 5.
Repeat step 4 for all of the .java files in the directory

Step 6.
with all java files downloaded, and with the compile button hit untill every class is just a solide orange rectangel (no diagnal grey lines)

Right click on the rectangle which says "TaylorDemonstrationDriver"
When you do so, a drop down menue will appear and the second option from the stop is "void main(String[] args)"
select this, and then hit ok again.

Step 6.
Congratulations! You have now started the program! A window shoul pop up with a selection of graphs and their names. Now click on the selection of images shown and press the buttons indicated in the visualization, I hope you enjoy. 

Once you have clicked on one of the images (within the black lines) you will be sent to an interactive graph, to go back to the selection screen, press the Q key on your keyboard.

From the selection menue you can press enter to end the program or press the "x" in the top left of the pop up screen at any time to end.
