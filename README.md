# BC-Final-Project
This everything you need to run my final Project yourself!

Step 1: Download blueJ
The link: https://www.bluej.org/
Dowload installer then run installer and download application, keep track of where you save things.

Step 2: Make a new Project in blueJ
Wether you are on a mac, or a pc, navigate to the drop down "Project" menue and select "New Project..."
Choose where to save the project

Step 3: Download Required Code and png images
link for all the images and the code: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1AIokAZUVOrttCGjmCOIdUQ7NF9tk_pxI?usp=sharing
Create a new folder (somewhere you can acess easily) and download all the files into the folder (select all and zip download).

Step 4: Import downloads into blueJ project
After you downloaded everything, go back to your blueJ project.
From the same drop down project menue, select "Import..."
Then find the folder you made and added downloads to in step 3.

Step 5: Run the program
Press the "compile" button in the blueJ project if necessary
Right click the orange rectangle titles "TaylorPolynomialDemonstration" there should only be one other called StdDraw
After right clicking, select "void main(String[] args)" from the drop down. 
You will recieve another prompt, click ok

Step 6: Controls
You are now running the program, which is displaying a selection menue. click on the variety of graphs to run the particular demonstration
Press "Q" on your keyboard to return to the selection menue from a graph
Press "P" to save an image of the demonstration at a particular moment. To find the png images that you save, navigate to the blueJ project directory.
Press "enter" or "return" to close the program at the selection screen, or press the x in the display window.
All additional controls are displayed once you have selected a graph but I will breifly explain some of the functionality.
The "turbo" section in the bottom left refers to how quickly you will be able to change a certain feature of the graph and or polynomial being displayed.
By having turbo = true, changes will be made very quickly which will contribute towards a more fluid and fast paced visualization
By having turbo = false, you will be able to increase or decrease the variety of "aspects" with much greater precision, but at the cost of speed.

If you don't want to mess around with turbo too much, I highly reccomend that you at least turn turbo = true for the graph which would be done by pressing "F"

Thank you hope you enjoy
